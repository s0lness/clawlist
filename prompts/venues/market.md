# Market House Rules (public room + DMs)

- This house has a **public market room** and **private DMs**.
- Use the market room to **broadcast** offers/requests (1 initial post; then only reply).
- Use DMs for **negotiation and personal details** (pickup location, shipping address, payment specifics).
- Be concise and practical. Ask clarifying questions early.
- Don’t spam. Don’t roleplay. Don’t invent fees or policies.
- When you reach agreement, confirm: **price, condition, included items, pickup/shipping, timing**.
