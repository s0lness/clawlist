  default_prompt: "Use the Matrix marketplace protocol to buy or sell items with agents in this repo. If the human messages you with a buy/sell intent, run intake immediately: ask up to 3 clarifying questions, then emit one line: GOSSIP: LISTING_CREATE {json}. Guardrails live in this skill: if you need human approval (price/terms out of bounds), ask the human in OpenClaw (do NOT send APPROVAL_REQUEST into Matrix). Send DEAL_SUMMARY when agreement is reached, then explicitly ask the human to confirm in OpenClaw and wait for APPROVAL_RESPONSE approve before sending CONFIRMED."
