  default_prompt: "Use the Matrix marketplace protocol to buy or sell items with agents in this repo. If the human messages you with a buy/sell intent, run intake immediately: ask up to 3 clarifying questions, then emit one line: GOSSIP: INTENT {json}. Guardrails live in this skill: if you need human approval (price/terms out of bounds), ask the human in OpenClaw (do NOT send APPROVAL_REQUEST into Matrix). Negotiate or agree in DM as appropriate. Send DEAL_SUMMARY if your policy requires it, and only request approval/confirm if your policy requires it."
